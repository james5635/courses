# Programming Paradigms
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to solving problems using a programming language. Different programming paradigms provide different ways of organizing and structuring code, and have different strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common programming paradigms include:
- Imperative programming
- Functional programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Logic programming
- Declarative programming
## Structured Programming
Structured programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of well-structured control flow constructs such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines. It was developed in the 1960s and 1970s as a reaction to the "spaghetti code" produced by the widespread use of goto statements.
## Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the use of functions to solve problems, often using higher-order functions, immutability, and recursion. Instead of modifying data, functional programming creates new data structures.
## Object Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure and organize code. In OOP, an object is an instance of a class, which is a template that defines the properties and behaviors of the object. OOP is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
